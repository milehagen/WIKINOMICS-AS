          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <h4>You can't be what you can't see</h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            According to Statistics Norway, over 30% of those who start a
            bachelor degree end up switching their field of study, or dropping
            out of school. In fact, only 50% of those who start a bachelor
            program graduate within 3 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            On a bigger scale, this means that it takes longer for young adults
            to get into the job market, and unemployment rates suffer.
          </p>
          <p>
            The root of the problem is that high school pupils are forced to
            make decisions about their future (what to study), based on limited
            information; school counselors have limited time, parents and
            friends have their own agenda, and your Google-search-efforts are
            limited by your knowledge about the different professions that
            exists.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are thousands of professions out there. But, top-of-mind for
            most of us are the 7-8 "standard" professions, such as: doctor,
            teacher, lawyer...sound familiar?
          </p>
          <h2>The Vision & Mission</h2>
          <p>
            Imagine a world where every single person loves their job...Don't
            you think that world would be at least 80% better? We do!
          </p>
          <p>
            Our missions is to open up the world of opportunities for young
            adults, so that they can explore and discover career paths

          <h2>Words From The Founder, <br />Mi Le Hagen</h2>
          <h3><b>Why "KnowONE"?</b></h3>
          <img
            src="../../assets/Images/aboutus/avatar.svg"
            alt=""
            class="homeImg"

          <p>
            After 10 years of work experience from both Google and LEGO, I've
            come across many people with super interesting jobs. And, I've often
            thought "man, I wish I knew about that profession when I was about
            to choose my field of study".
          </p>

          <p>
            On behalf of my younger self, I wish that I could reach out to
            <i><u>anyone</u></i> who had an interesting title, or a job that
            seemed cool, and ask them: "What did you study? What do you earn?
            What's the best part about your job? What's the worst part about
            your job?".
          </p>

          <p>
            In December 2019, I decided to hand in my resignation letter to
            LEGO, my employer at the time. And, with a 3-month notice period, I
            was without a job in March, 2020. Yup, in the midst of the Covid19
            pandemic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite not having a clear idea on how I was going to spend my time
            while unemployed, there was one thing I wanted find out. I wanted to
            get a better understanding of how people make decisions regarding
            their field of study, or choice of profession. And, after
            conversations with countless of people, it hit me that the same
            sentence was repeated over and over again:
          </p>
          <p>
            "I wanted to study engineering. But, I <b>didn't know anyone</b> who
            is an engineer."<br />
            "I became a doctor, because I <b>knew many people</b> who were
            doctors..."
          </p>

          <p>
            I realised that; for most of us, our career paths have been highly
            influenced by people around us- the people within our network. This
            means that, our source of reference - or, source of information, if
            you will- is limited by the size of our network.
          </p>

          <p>
            You're probably thinking: "What about Google, that's a good source
            of information?" And, sure, we can- of course- Google our way
            through many of our questions. But, it's not the same as getting
            answers from real people- people who have direct experience within
            the field of our curiosity. And, this is how the idea of "KnowONE"
            came about.
          </p>
          <p>
            KnowONE. Get to <b>know ONE</b> person. And, benefit from the
            <b>Know</b>ledge, network, and experience of <b>ONE</b>. Because,
            sometimes that's all it takes to get the information you need to
            develop yourself, and your career.
